# 17.2 Understanding Kinesis 
 
 - **Kinesis vs SQS**
  - Kinesis is ideal when **multiple consumers** need to process the same data
  - Unlike SQS, data in Kinesis can be read by multiple consumers independently

- **What is Amazon Kinesis**
  - A **collection of streaming services** for real-time data ingestion and processing
  - Designed to handle extremely large volumes of streaming data
  - Fully **serverless**

- **Kinesis Sub-Services**
  - **Kinesis Video Streams**
    - Ingests and stores video streams (e.g., webcams, cameras)
    - Supports indexing, machine learning, and backend processing
  - **Kinesis Data Streams**
    - Ingests high-throughput data streams for real-time processing
    - Core focus of this lesson and demo
  - **Kinesis Data Firehose**
    - Delivers streaming data to destinations like S3 and Redshift
    - Supports data transformation and backup storage
  - **Kinesis Data Analytics**
    - Performs real-time, time-based analytics
    - Useful for dashboards and real-time metrics

- **Kinesis Data Streams Key Concepts**
  - **Producers**
    - Applications that send data records into a stream
  - **Consumers**
    - Applications or services that read records from a stream
    - Multiple consumers can read the same data
  - **Streams**
    - Logical grouping of ordered data records
  - **Records**
    - Individual units of data in a stream
    - Processed in **FIFO (first in, first out)** order

- **Shards**
  - A shard represents a sequence of records within a stream
  - One or more shards make up a stream
  - Defines the stream’s throughput capacity

- **Shard Capacity Limits**
  - **Writes**
    - Up to **1 MiB per second** or **1,000 records per second** per shard
  - **Reads**
    - Up to **5 transactions per second**
    - Maximum **2 MiB per second**
  - No upper limit on:
    - Number of streams per account
    - Number of shards per stream
  - Default shard limits per region:
    - **500 shards**: Northern Virginia, Oregon, Ireland
    - **200 shards**: All other regions

- **Partition Keys**
  - Used to group data within a stream
  - Similar to a DynamoDB partition key
  - Application specifies the partition key when sending records
  - Determines which shard receives the data

- **Architecture Overview**
  - Producers send data into a Kinesis data stream
  - Data is distributed across shards
  - Multiple consumers process the same data in parallel
  - Consumers can include DynamoDB, S3, Firehose, or other services

- **Kinesis Data Firehose**
  - Takes data from streams and delivers it to destinations
  - Supports record transformation
  - Can store:
    - Transformed data (e.g., Redshift)
    - Original raw data in a backup S3 bucket

- **Kinesis Data Analytics**
  - Analyzes streaming data in real time
  - Generates time-series analytics
  - Enables real-time dashboards and metrics

- **Key Takeaway**
  - Kinesis is a powerful, scalable solution for real-time streaming data
  - Best choice when multiple consumers must process the same data stream
