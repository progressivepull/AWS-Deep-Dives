# 17.3 Exploring streams 
 
- **Key Difference from SQS**
  - Kinesis supports **multiple consumers** reading the same stream of data
  - Each consumer processes data independently

- **Demo Overview**
  - Demonstrates multiple consumers reading from a single Kinesis data stream
  - Uses simple **producer and consumer scripts**

## Project Setup

- **Code Base**
  - [consumer.py](./../CODE/Kinesis/1_data_streams/consumer.py)
  - [create_stream.py](./../CODE/Kinesis/1_data_streams/create_stream.py)
  - [delete_stream.py](./../CODE/Kinesis/1_data_streams/delete_stream.py)
  - [producer.py](./../CODE/Kinesis/1_data_streams/producer.py)
  - [words.json](./../CODE/Kinesis/1_data_streams/words.json)

- **Repository contains:**
    - Producer script
    - Consumer script
    - `words.json` file with sample data
    - `config.json` for configuration
  - Producer reads words from `words.json` and sends them to Kinesis
  - Stream name is defined in `config.json`
  - Stream must be created manually (scripts do not auto-create it)

- **Stream Configuration**
  - Region: **us-east-2 (Ohio)**
  - Stream type: **Kinesis Data Stream**
  - Provisioned mode with **1 shard**
  - Stream name matches the value in `config.json`

- **Creating the Stream**
  - Created via the AWS Kinesis console
  - Stream became active quickly despite message suggesting up to 10 minutes

- **Running the Demo**
  - Started one producer process
  - Started two separate consumer processes
  - Producer sends data records into the stream
  - Both consumers read from the same shard

- **Observed Behavior**
  - Data appears in both consumers
  - Records overlap between consumers
  - Consumption timing differs between consumers
  - Each consumer independently queries the shard

- **Key Result**
  - A single producer can send data to a stream
  - Multiple consumers can read the **same data** from that stream
  - Confirms Kinesis’ ability to support fan-out consumption

- **Takeaway**
  - Kinesis Data Streams are ideal when multiple applications need access to the same real-time data
  - Consumers do not interfere with one another
