 # 📘 Module Four: Messaging Services — Summary

Modern applications often adopt a **microservices architecture**, which requires system components to communicate efficiently and reliably.

To enable this communication, applications rely on **queuing and messaging services** that support asynchronous interactions and system decoupling.

- A **cloud-based email service**
- Supports **transactional and marketing emails**
- Designed for high deliverability and scalability

## Module Focus

This module emphasizes how AWS messaging services:
- Enable **reliable** communication
