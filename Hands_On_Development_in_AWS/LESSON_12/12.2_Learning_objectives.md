Introduced into production in **2004**, SQS is a **distributed message queuing service** designed to enable reliable communication between components of distributed systems.

## What Is SQS?

- A fully **managed AWS service**
- Allows applications to **store messages for later processing**
- Supports **programmatic interaction** using AWS SDKs and APIs
- Helps **decouple system components** and improve scalability

## Lesson Objectives

In this lesson, you will learn:
- What **SQS queues** are and how they work
- How to **create and use SQS queues**
- How to **interact with SQS from AWS Lambda**
  - Using Lambda as a **serverless code execution environment**
  - Processing messages automatically and efficiently
