# 9.7 Using DynamoDB best practices 
 
 # DynamoDB Best Practices Overview

## Introduction

DynamoDB is a powerful NoSQL database service designed for high performance and scalability. While its flexibility enables a wide range of use cases, understanding and applying best practices is crucial for building efficient, scalable applications.

This document outlines key best practices for DynamoDB design and usage.

---

## 1. Understand Relational vs. NoSQL Design

### Relational Model (RDS)
- Multiple tables with defined relationships (foreign keys, joins)
- Normalized data structure
- Example: MySQL, PostgreSQL

### NoSQL Model (DynamoDB)
- Denormalized data structure
- Prefer **single-table design** using composite keys
- Related data stored together to reduce joins and improve access patterns

> ✅ **Best Practice**: Use as few tables as possible. Design your data model around access patterns, not normalization.

---

## 2. Use Composite Keys Effectively

- **Partition Key**: Determines the physical location of data
- **Sort Key**: Enables sorting and grouping within a partition

> ✅ **Best Practice**: Use composite keys to model relationships and access patterns within a single table.

---

## 3. Avoid Hot Partitions

- Queries should be distributed across partition keys
- Avoid repeatedly querying the same partition key

> ✅ **Best Practice**: Design partition keys to evenly distribute workload and prevent hotspots.

---

## 4. Optimize Query Performance

- **Query** is fast and efficient
- **Scan** is slow and resource-intensive

> ✅ **Best Practice**: Prefer queries over scans. Use filters and indexes to narrow results.

---

## 5. Use Global Secondary Indexes (GSIs)

- GSIs allow querying on non-key attributes
- Can be added after table creation

> ✅ **Best Practice**: Use GSIs to support additional access patterns  
> ❌ **Caution**: Local Secondary Indexes (LSIs) must be defined at table creation and cannot be added later.

---

## 6. Enable Autoscaling or Use On-Demand Mode

- Provisioned throughput can lead to throttling if limits are exceeded
- Autoscaling adjusts capacity based on usage
- On-demand mode eliminates the need to manage capacity

> ✅ **Best Practice**: Use autoscaling or on-demand mode to handle variable workloads and prevent throttling.

## 7. Additional Resources

For a comprehensive guide to DynamoDB best practices, refer to the official AWS documentation:

## Conclusion

These highlights represent just a fraction of the best practices available for DynamoDB. A full-day workshop could easily be dedicated to exploring its design patterns, performance tuning, and operational strategies. Start with these principles to build scalable, efficient, and resilient applications.
