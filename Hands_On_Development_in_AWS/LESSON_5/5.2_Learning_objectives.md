 # üîê Identity and Access Management (IAM)
Security is central to AWS, and IAM plays a key role by managing:

* **Authentication & Authorization:** Ensures users are who they say they are and have appropriate access.

* **User Accounts:** Supports both interactive (console) and programmatic (API/CLI) access.

* **Access Control:** Enables fine-grained permissions across AWS services.
