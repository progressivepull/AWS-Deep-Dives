# 5.6 Exploring roles 
 
# üõ°Ô∏è What Is an IAM Role?

An **IAM role** is an identity in AWS that can be assumed by:

* AWS services (like EC2)

* Users or applications

* External accounts (cross-account access)

Roles allow temporary access without sharing long-term credentials.

# üîê Why Use Roles Instead of Programmatic Credentials?

Without roles:

* You‚Äôd create a user with **Access Key ID** and **Secret Access Key**

* Developers might embed these in code or environment variables

* Risk of credential exposure (e.g., committing to public repositories)

With roles:

* No credentials are distributed

* Permissions are securely granted via role association

* Ideal for applications running on EC2 instances

### üñ•Ô∏è Scenario

![instances.jpg](./IMAGES/5.6_Exploring_roles/instances.jpg)

* EC2 instance named **RoleDemo** running Amazon Linux

* CLI pre-installed, but no credentials configured

### ‚ùå Initial Attempt
* Running **aws ec2 describe-instances** failed due to missing credentials

### ‚úÖ Role Creation & Attachment
* Created IAM role: **EC2RoleToInteractWithEC2**

* Attached **EC2FullAccess** policy

* Associated role with the EC2 instance via IAM settings

### üîÑ Re-Test
* Re-ran the same CLI command

* It succeeded without configuring credentials

# üß† Key Takeaways

* IAM roles eliminate the need to share sensitive credentials

* Roles can be attached to EC2 instances to grant secure access

* Once attached, applications or CLI commands on the instance inherit permissions

* This method is safer, scalable, and ideal for production environments

# AWS IAM Roles

## Overview
In **Amazon Web Services (AWS)**, an **IAM Role** is an identity that defines a set of **permissions** to make AWS service requests. Unlike IAM users, roles are **not tied to a single person or long-term credentials**. Instead, they provide **temporary security credentials** that trusted entities (such as users, applications, or AWS services) can assume.

---

## Why AWS Uses Roles

### 1. Temporary Security Credentials
- Roles issue **short-lived credentials** via AWS Security Token Service (STS).
- Avoids embedding permanent IAM user keys in applications or scripts.
- Example: An application on **EC2** uses a role to access **S3**.

---

### 2. Cross-Account Access
- Roles enable secure **access between AWS accounts**.
- Avoids sharing static credentials across accounts.
- Example: A role in **Account B** can be assumed by a user or service from **Account A**.

---

### 3. Service-to-Service Access
- AWS services often need to interact securely.
- Roles allow one service to call another **without manual credentials**.
- Example: **Lambda** function assumes an execution role to write logs in **CloudWatch**.

---

### 4. Principle of Least Privilege
- Roles define **fine-grained permissions**.
- Users and services only get the access needed for the task at hand.
- Helps maintain strong **security boundaries**.

---

### 5. Security and Credential Rotation
- Temporary credentials are **automatically rotated**.
- Minimizes risk of credential exposure and reduces attack surface.
- Example: Even if compromised, temporary credentials **expire quickly**.

---

### 6. Federated Access (SSO Integration)
- Roles integrate with **identity providers** (IdPs) like Okta, Azure AD, or Google Workspace.
- Enables external users to log in via **Single Sign-On (SSO)**.
- No need to create individual IAM users in AWS.

---

## How Roles Work

1. **Entity (User/Service)** requests to assume a role.
2. AWS STS issues **temporary security credentials**.
3. The entity uses these credentials to access AWS resources based on the role‚Äôs policy.

---

## Example Use Cases
- **EC2 Instance Role**: Allows EC2 to access S3 without storing credentials.
- **Cross-Account Role**: Lets Account A‚Äôs users manage resources in Account B.
- **Federated Role**: Enables enterprise users to access AWS via SSO.
- **Lambda Execution Role**: Grants Lambda functions access to DynamoDB or CloudWatch.

---

‚úÖ In short: AWS uses roles to enable secure, temporary, and flexible access management between users, services, and accounts‚Äîreducing the need for permanent credentials and simplifying permissions.
