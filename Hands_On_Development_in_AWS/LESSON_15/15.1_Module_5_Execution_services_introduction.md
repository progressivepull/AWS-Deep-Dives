# 15.1 Module 5 Execution services introduction 
 
 # Module Five Summary: Execution Services

Module Five introduces **Execution Services** in AWS, highlighting how you can run code without relying solely on EC2 instances. Instead of managing servers yourself, AWS offers several fully managed services that handle the underlying infrastructure for you. This allows you to focus entirely on writing and optimizing your application logic.

## Key Idea
AWS provides multiple execution-focused services that:
- Automatically manage servers, scaling, and availability  
- Reduce operational overhead  
- Let you deploy and run code with minimal infrastructure concerns  

## What This Module Covers
This module reviews a variety of AWS services designed to execute your code efficiently, including:
- **Serverless compute options**
- **Container-based execution environments**
- **Fully managed orchestration tools**

These services empower you to build applications faster while AWS handles the heavy lifting behind the scenes.
