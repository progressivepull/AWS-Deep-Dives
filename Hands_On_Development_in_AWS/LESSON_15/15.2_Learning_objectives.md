 # Lesson 14 Summary: AWS Lambda

Lesson 14 introduces **AWS Lambda**, a core service in the world of serverless computing. Lambda allows you to run code without provisioning or managing servers, shifting your focus entirely to application logic rather than infrastructure.

## Key Concepts
- **Serverless Execution**: Lambda automatically handles compute resources, scaling, and availability.
- **Function-Based Model**: Similar to the idea of *lambda abstractions* or *anonymous functions* from computer science, but in AWS these functions are fully managed and not anonymous.
- **Event-Driven**: Lambda functions are triggered by events such as API calls, file uploads, or changes in data streams.

## What You’ll Learn
This lesson explores:
- What AWS Lambda is  
- How Lambda functions work  
- How to create, configure, and invoke Lambda functions  

Lambda provides a powerful way to build scalable, efficient applications without worrying about servers.
