# 15.3 Highlighting Lambda 
 
 # AWS Lambda Overview

## What Is AWS Lambda?
AWS Lambda is a core component of the **serverless application model**. It allows you to run code without managing servers, automatically scaling based on demand.

Think of Lambda like a worker: you provide the code, and AWS executes it in response to events.

## Key Characteristics

### Serverless Compute
- Run code without provisioning servers or clusters  
- Pay only when your function is running  
- No cost when idle  
- AWS handles all underlying infrastructure  

### Hands-Off Administration
**AWS manages:**
- Runtime environment  
- Operating system  
- Server hardware  
- Power, cooling, and rack space  
- Monitoring and logging  
- Automatic scaling  

**You manage:**
- Your code  
- Memory and timeout settings  
- IAM permissions

## Supported Languages
AWS Lambda supports several major programming languages:
- Node.js  
- Python  
- C# (.NET)  
- Go  
- Java

## Execution Model

### Event-Driven Invocation
Lambda functions can be triggered by many AWS services, including:
- API Gateway  
- S3 (for example, object uploads)  
- DynamoDB Streams  
- SNS  
- Cognito  
- CloudWatch Events / EventBridge (cron schedules)  
- Alexa  

### Container Lifecycle
- Functions run inside lightweight containers  
- The first invocation may experience a **cold start**  
- Containers may be frozen and thawed for reuse  
- Reuse is **not guaranteed**  

### Temporary Storage
- Each container receives **500 MB** of `/tmp` storage  
- Data persists only if the same container is reused  

**Common pattern:**
1. Check for data in `/tmp`  
2. If missing, download or generate it  
3. Validate and reuse on subsequent invocations  

---

## Configuration and Limits
You configure:
- Memory allocation  
- Maximum execution time  

**Default concurrency limit:**
- 1,000 concurrent executions per region  
- Limit increases can be requested

## Common Event Source Examples

### S3 → Lambda
Triggered when an object is uploaded.

**Example:**
- User uploads a photo  
- Lambda resizes it (thumbnail, medium, original)  
- Processed images are stored back in S3  

### DynamoDB Streams
- Trigger Lambda when table items change  

### SNS
- Lambda subscribes to topics for fan-out processing  

### Cognito
- Trigger Lambda during authentication flows  

### EventBridge (CloudWatch Events)
- Cron-like scheduled execution  

### API Gateway → Lambda
- One of the most common integrations  
- API request data can be passed directly to Lambda using proxy integration  

---

## Example Workflows

### S3 Image Processing
1. User uploads an image to S3  
2. S3 triggers Lambda  
3. Lambda processes the image  
4. Lambda stores results back in S3  

### API Request Handling
1. Client calls an API endpoint  
2. API Gateway triggers Lambda  
3. Lambda processes the request and returns a response

## Summary
AWS Lambda is a powerful, scalable, event-driven compute service that eliminates the need for server management. With automatic scaling, flexible triggers, and broad language support, Lambda is a foundational building block for modern serverless architectures.
