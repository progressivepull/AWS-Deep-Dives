# 15.4 Understanding Lambda scalability and availability 
 
# Understanding AWS Lambda Scalability and Availability

This summary covers key limits, scalability behaviors, and availability considerations for AWS Lambda functions.

## Lambda Resource Limits (Per Invocation)

- **Memory**:  
  - Minimum: 128 MB  
  - Maximum: 3 GB  
  - Adjustable in 64 MB increments  

- **Disk Space**:  
  - 512 MB available in the `/tmp` directory  
  - Data can persist between container freeze/thaw cycles  
  - Developers must validate data freshness (e.g., checksums, database validation)

- **Execution Environment**:  
  - Up to 1024 file descriptors  
  - Limited number of threads and processes per function execution  

- **Execution Duration**:  
  - Maximum: 900 seconds (15 minutes)  
  - Configurable per function  
  - Typical Lambda executions last only a few seconds  

## Request and Payload Limits

- **Maximum invocation request body size**: 6 MB  
- **Maximum payload size**: 128 KB  
  - Difference depends on synchronous vs. asynchronous invocation  

## Concurrency and Auto-Scaling

- **Default concurrency limit**:  
  - 1000 concurrent executions per function, per region  

- **Concurrency Management**:  
  - Limits can be increased via AWS Support request  
  - You can set account-level and function-level concurrency limits  
  - Helps prevent unexpected high costs  

- **Auto-Scaling Behavior**:  
  - Lambda automatically scales based on demand  
  - Scales up to the configured concurrency limit  
  - Regional burst limits vary (e.g., Ireland, Oregon, Northern Virginia up to 3000)  
  - After the initial burst, scaling increases by 500 concurrent executions per minute  
  - Scaling continues until reaching the account safety limit set by the user  

## Deployment Package and Configuration Limits

- **Deployment package size (zipped)**: 50 MB (can be increased)  
- **Total unzipped deployment package size**: 250 MB  
- **Total deployment packages per region**: 75 GB  
- **Environment variables size limit**: 4 KB  

## Key Takeaways

- AWS Lambda provides strong auto-scaling and high availability by default.  
- Most limits (memory, concurrency, package size) are adjustable with valid justification.  
- Proper concurrency controls help balance scalability with cost management.  
- Understanding regional scaling behavior is important for high-traffic workloads.
