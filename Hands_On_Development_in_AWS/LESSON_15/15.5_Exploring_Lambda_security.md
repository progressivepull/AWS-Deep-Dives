# 15.5 Exploring Lambda security 
 
 # Exploring AWS Lambda Security

- **What to Secure in Lambda**
  - User access to the Lambda service itself
  - What Lambda functions are allowed to access and do

- **IAM Integration**
  - Lambda is tightly integrated with AWS IAM
  - IAM policies control:
    - Who can access the Lambda service
    - Who can invoke specific Lambda functions
    - What resources a Lambda function can access

- **Network Security**
  - Lambda functions can be attached to a VPC
  - Enables use of:
    - Security Groups
    - Network Access Control Lists (NACLs)
  - Controls inbound and outbound network traffic between Lambda and other resources

- **Compliance**
  - AWS Lambda complies with major standards, including:
    - SOC
    - HIPAA
    - PCI
    - ISO
  - AWS provides documentation listing all supported compliance programs

- **Lambda Execution Role**
  - An IAM role associated directly with a Lambda function
  - Defines permissions for actions the function is allowed to perform
  - Example use cases:
    - Writing logs to CloudWatch
    - Accessing DynamoDB
    - Publishing messages to SNS

- **AWS Managed Policies**
  - AWS provides managed IAM policies specifically for Lambda
  - These can be attached to execution roles to simplify setup

- **Practical Example**
  - A Lambda function triggered by EventBridge (cron job)
  - Function retrieves stock data and sends an email notification
  - Execution role permissions include:
    - Basic Lambda execution role (CloudWatch logging)
    - SNS access to publish messages to a topic
  - SNS topic sends email notifications to a subscribed user

- **Best Practices**
  - Avoid granting full access unless absolutely necessary
  - Follow the principle of least privilege
  - Grant only the permissions required for the Lambda function to operate
