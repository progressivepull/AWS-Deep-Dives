# 7.4 Using Amazon Machine Images (AMI) marketplace 

# üß¨ EC2 AMI Overview & Demo Summary
### üß± What Is an AMI?
* An **Amazon Machine Image (AMI)** is a snapshot of a configured EC2 instance.

* Acts as a **gold master** for launching new instances.

* Includes:

    - Operating system

    - Installed applications

    - Configuration settings

### üóÇÔ∏è AMI Sources

| **Source Type**      | **Description**                                                                 |
|----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **AWS Provided**     | Default operating system images (e.g., Ubuntu, Amazon Linux, Windows, macOS)    |
| **Marketplace AMIs** | Vendor-published AMIs with pre-installed software (e.g., Cisco, Splunk)         |
| **Community AMIs**   | AMIs shared by AWS users; often free and publicly accessible                    |
| **My AMIs**          | Custom AMIs created from your own configured EC2 instances                      |

### üõ†Ô∏è Creating & Using Custom AMIs
* Ideal for replicating configured environments (e.g., Apache + SSL).

* Steps:

1. Launch and configure one EC2 instance.

2. Create an AMI from it.

3. Use that AMI to launch multiple identical instances.

* Custom AMIs appear under **My AMIs** in the EC2 console.

### üõçÔ∏è Launching a Marketplace AMI
* Access via **Browse More AMIs** in the EC2 launch wizard.

* Categories include:

    - Infrastructure software

    - DevOps tools

    - Business apps

    - IoT & ML platforms

* Example vendors:

    - **Cisco:** CSR (Cloud Services Router), ASAv (Adaptive Security Appliance)

    - **Bitnami:** LAMP stack

    - **Kali Linux:** Pen-testing distro

    - **Splunk:** Log analysis platform

| **BYOL (Bring Your Own License)** | Pay vendor directly and apply license to the AMI (e.g., Cisco CSR) |


# üß™ Demo Actions
1. **Created a custom AMI** from a configured EC2 instance.

2. **Launched a Marketplace AMI** to explore vendor-packaged applications.

# üß¨ EC2 AMI Creation & Marketplace AMI Demo Summary

### üõ†Ô∏è Part 1: Creating a Custom AMI
#### üîß Setup & Snapshot
* Connected to an existing EC2 instance **(LiveDemos)** via SSH profile.

* Created a simple file **(vi file)** with content to demonstrate persistence.

* Navigated to **Actions ‚Üí Image ‚Üí Create Image**.

* Named the AMI: **ADGUDemosAMI_202210**.

* Chose **No Reboot** option (slower but avoids downtime).

* AMI creation initiated; status shown under **Images ‚Üí AMIs**.

#### üß™ Launching from Custom AMI
* Once AMI was available, launched a new EC2 instance **(deleteme)** using it.

* Selected:

    - AMI: **ADGUDemosAMI_202210**

    - Instance type: **t2.micro**

    - Key pair: **ADGULive**

    - Security group: **SSH_Only**

* Verified that the previously created file persisted in the new instance.

* ‚úÖ Demonstrated that custom AMIs retain OS state, files, and installed software.

### üõçÔ∏è Part 2: Launching a Marketplace AMI
#### üîç AMI Selection
* Searched for **Re:dash** in the full AMI catalog.

* Selected **Re:dash packaged by Bitnami** from AWS Marketplace.

* Reviewed:

    - Pricing details (based on instance type)

    - Recommended instance: **t3a.medium**

    - Usage instructions (copied for later reference)

### üöÄ Launch Process
* Selected instance type, key pair, and allowed recommended security group:

    - Inbound: SSH and HTTP

* Instance launched and subscribed to Marketplace AMI.

* Accessed instance via public DNS in browser.

* Retrieved login credentials from **System Logs**:

    - Username: user@example.com

    - Password: found in logs

### üßπ Cleanup
* Logged into Re:dash web interface.

* Terminated the instance to avoid charges for **t3a.medium**.
