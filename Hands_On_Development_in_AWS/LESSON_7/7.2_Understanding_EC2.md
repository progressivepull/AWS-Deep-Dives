# 7.2 Understanding EC2 
 
# ☁️ AWS EC2 Overview – Lesson Summary
## 🧱 What Is EC2?
* **Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2)** is a foundational AWS service launched in 2006.

* It provides **virtual servers** in the cloud—scalable, flexible, and pay-as-you-go.

* EC2 is considered **Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)**.

## ⚙️ Key Features
* **Elasticity:** Scale instances up/down based on demand.

* **Hypervisor:** Originally used Xen; now uses AWS’s custom Nitro hypervisor.

* **Free Tier:** 750 hours/month with t2.micro instance.

## ⏱️ Time-Based Scaling Example
* Midnight: 5 instances (baseline)

* 6 AM: Scale to 50 (East Coast activity)

* Noon: Peak at 150 (West Coast joins)

* Evening: Scale down back to 5

## 💰 EC2 Pricing Models

| **Model**         | **Description**                                                   | **Cost Efficiency**     |
|-------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------|
| **On-Demand**     | Pay hourly with no long-term commitment                           | 💸 High cost             |
| **Spot**          | Bid on unused EC2 capacity; instances may terminate unexpectedly  | 💰 Very low cost         |
| **Reserved**      | Commit to 1–3 years for significant discounts (up to 75%)         | ✅ Cost-effective         |
| **Dedicated Host**| Rent an entire physical server for compliance or licensing needs  | 🏢 Specialized use case   |

## 🌍 Region-Based Pricing
* Costs vary by region due to power, cooling, and infrastructure.

* Example: ```t2.micro``` in US East (Ohio) ≈ $0.0116/hour.

## 🧬 Instance Types
* Instance types are grouped by family, generation, and size.

* Examples: ```t2.micro```, ```m5.large```, ```g4dn.xlarge``` (GPU-enabled)

## 🖥️ Operating Systems
* **Linux:** Amazon Linux 2, Ubuntu, Red Hat, SUSE, Debian

* **Windows:** Server editions with SQL/web/standard options
