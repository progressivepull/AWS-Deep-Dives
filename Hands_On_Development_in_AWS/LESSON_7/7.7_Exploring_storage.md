# 7.7 Exploring storage 
 
# 💾 Elastic Block Store (EBS) in AWS – Summary
#### 📌 What Is EBS?
* **Elastic Block Store** provides persistent block-level storage for EC2 instances.

* Volumes behave like virtual hard drives:

    - Can be **attached, formatted, mounted, unmounted,** and **re-attached**.

    - Data persists across instance stops and reboots.

### 🧪 Demo Overview
#### 🛠️ Volume Creation
* Created a **12 GB EBS volume** in **US East 1B** to match the availability zone of two EC2 instances (**live demos** and live **demos two**).

* Volume status changed from creating to available.

#### 🔗 Volume Attachment
* Attached volume to **live demos** instance.

* Device name: **/dev/sdf** → recognized as **/dev/xvdf** by Linux.

#### 🧱 Partitioning & Formatting
1. Used **fdisk** to create a **primary partition** on **/dev/xvdf**.

2. Formatted partition as **EXT4**:

``` bash
mkfs.ext4 /dev/xvdf1
```

3. Mounted it to a directory:

``` bash
mkdir /mnt/xvdf1
mount /dev/xvdf1 /mnt/xvdf1
```

4. Created a test file:

```bash
echo "hello there" > /mnt/xvdf1/file
```

#### 🔄 Detaching & Reattaching
⚠️ Force Detach
* Attempted to unmount but got “target is busy” error.

* Used **force detach** from EC2 console.

* Instance became unstable (volume still mounted but no longer exists).

* Reboot recommended to resolve.

#### 🔁 Reattach to Another Instance
* Attached volume to **live demos two**.

* Mounted it again and verified data:

``` bash
cat /mnt/xvdf1/file  # Output: hello there
``` 

### 📊 Key Takeaways
| Feature |	Benefit |
|---------|---------|
| **EBS Volume**	|Persistent, re-attachable block storage|
|**Cross-instance use** |	Can move volumes between instances
| **Formatting & Mounting** |	Required before use |
| **Force Detach**|	Possible but risky; reboot may be needed|
| **Data Persistence** |	Data remains intact across reattachments |
