# 7.3 Provisioning instances 

# 🧪 EC2 Instance Provisioning & Login 
### 🔧 Launching a Linux Instance
* Logged into AWS Management Console using IAM credentials (free trial account).

* Navigated to **EC2 service** → clicked **Launch Instance**.

* Named the instance **LiveDemos**.

* Selected **Ubuntu 22.04 LTS** AMI (free tier eligible).

* Chose **t2.micro** instance type (common for demos and free tier).
 
###  🔐 Key Pair Setup (Linux)
* Created a new RSA key pair named ```ADGULive```.

* Downloaded ```.pem``` file containing the **private key**.

* AWS stores the **public key**, which is injected into the instance’s ```authorized_keys``` file.

* Enables **SSH login** using public/private key authentication (no password required).

### 📦 Instance Configuration
* Configured storage (volume size, type, optional encryption).

* Adjusted instance count (scaling).

* Accessed **advanced details** for further customization.

### 🚀 Launch & Security Group
* Instance launched successfully; status: **pending**.

* AWS auto-generated a security group: **Launch Wizard 1**.

* Default inbound rule: **SSH access from anywhere** **(0.0.0.0/0)**.

⚠️ **Best Practice:** Avoid using auto-generated security groups long-term. Create and manage your own for clarity and control.


# 🧪 EC2 Instance Provisioning & Access – Linux and Windows
## 🛡️ Security Group Best Practices
* Avoid cluttered auto-generated groups like **Launch Wizard 1, Launch Wizard 2**.

* Created a custom group: **SSH_Only** with inbound SSH (port 22) from anywhere.

* Security groups are tied to a **VPC**; used the default VPC in this demo.

### 🐧 Launching & Connecting to a Linux Instance
#### 🔧 Launch Steps
* Instance name: **LiveDemos**

* AMI: **Ubuntu 22.04 LTS** (free tier eligible)

* Instance type: **t2.micro**

* Created RSA key pair: **ADGULive.pem**

* Enabled **auto-assign public IP** (default in default VPC)

### 🔐 SSH Authentication
* Used **Xshell** to connect via public/private key pair.

* Username: **ubuntu** (for Ubuntu AMI)

* Imported **.pem** file for authentication.

* Verified connection and ran:

``` bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade -y
```
* Located public key in **~/.ssh/authorized_keys**.

### 🪟 Launching & Connecting to a Windows Instance
🔧 Launch Steps
* Instance name: **WindowsDeleteMe**

* AMI: **Windows Server 2022 Base** (free tier eligible)

* Instance type: **t2.micro**

* Used same key pair: **ADGULive.pem**

* Created security group: **Launch Wizard 2** with inbound RDP (port 3389)

### 🔐 RDP Authentication
* Downloaded RDP file or used **mstsc** (Windows+R → Remote Desktop).

* Retrieved A**dministrator password** via AWS Console:

    - Uploaded **.pem** file to decrypt password.

* Connected using public IP and decrypted password.

### 🧹 Cleanup & Cost Management
* **Terminated** Windows instance to avoid consuming free tier hours.

* Kept Linux instance **(LiveDemos)** for ongoing course demos.

* Reminder: EC2 is **pay-as-you-go**; termination stops billing.
