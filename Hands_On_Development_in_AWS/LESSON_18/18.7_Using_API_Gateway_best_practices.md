# 18.7 Using API Gateway best practices 
 
 - **Use a Web Application Firewall (WAF)**
  - Recommended to protect APIs from common HTTP-level attacks
  - Monitors and filters traffic flowing through API Gateway

- **Enable AWS X-Ray Tracing**
  - Provides visibility into request flows across AWS services
  - Helps trace performance issues and service interactions
  - View traces in CloudWatch and X-Ray consoles

- **Enable API Logging**
  - Recommended to turn on logging for APIs
  - Helps with debugging, monitoring, and auditing requests

- **Client-Side SSL Certificate Validation**
  - Supports **mutual TLS (mTLS)** authentication
  - Verifies the identity of API callers
  - Recommended only when strong client authentication is required

- **Enable Detailed CloudWatch Metrics**
  - Provides deeper operational insights
  - Helps monitor latency, errors, and request volume

- **Use Response Caching**
  - Caches API responses for identical requests
  - Reduces backend load and improves performance
  - Supports **cache encryption** at the stage level

- **Restrict Access**
  - Limit API access to known and trusted entities
  - Use **private endpoints** where possible
  - Integrate APIs with VPCs to reduce public exposure

- **TLS Certificate Management**
  - Rotate and renew TLS certificates regularly
  - Ensures continued secure communication

- **Enable CloudTrail and AWS Config**
  - **CloudTrail** tracks API calls and user activity
  - **AWS Config** records configuration changes over time
  - Recommended for auditing and change tracking of API Gateway resources

- **Apply Principle of Least Privilege**
  - Distinguish between **API developers** and **app developers**
  - Grant API developers only the IAM permissions they require
  - Reduces security risk and limits potential impact of misuse

- **Key Takeaway**
  - API Gateway security and reliability depend on layered protections
  - Best practices focus on visibility, access control, and least privilege
