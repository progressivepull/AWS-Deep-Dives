# 18.5 Integrating using HTTP 
 
 - **Purpose of the Demo**
  - Demonstrates using an **HTTP private integration** in API Gateway
  - Exposes a resource inside a **VPC** through API Gateway

- **Backend Setup**
  - Launched an **EC2 Ubuntu instance** running Apache
  - Instance located in **Northern Virginia (us-east-1)**
  - Web server accessible over HTTP (Apache default page)
  - Instance placed inside a VPC
  - Public IP used only for demo verification

- **VPC Link Creation**
  - Created a **VPC Link for HTTP APIs**
  - Selected:
    - Correct VPC
    - Subnet containing the EC2 instance
    - Security group allowing HTTP (port 80)
  - VPC link creation took several minutes

- **API Gateway Configuration**
  - Created a new **HTTP API**
  - Enabled **auto-deploy** (no manual deployment required)
  - Used default stage
  - Obtained an invocation URL automatically

- **Route Setup**
  - Created a route using the **ANY** method
  - Attached a new integration to the route

- **Integration Configuration**
  - Integration type: **Private resource**
  - Selected an existing **Application Load Balancer**
  - Load balancer listener: HTTP on port 80
  - Target group points to EC2 instance running Apache
  - Associated the integration with the created **VPC link**

- **Deployment and Testing**
  - Auto-deploy handled publishing changes
  - Accessed the API Gateway invocation URL
  - Successfully reached the Apache web server through API Gateway

- **Security Considerations**
  - Public IP on EC2 instance used only for demonstration
  - Best practice:
    - EC2 instances should have **no public IP**
    - Access only via load balancer and API Gateway
    - API Gateway becomes the sole internet-facing entry point

- **Benefits of HTTP Private Integration**
  - Exposes private VPC resources securely
  - Centralized access control via API Gateway
  - Supports:
    - Throttling
    - Usage plans
    - Chargebacks
    - Tagging
    - Access policies

- **Key Takeaway**
  - HTTP private integrations allow API Gateway to securely proxy traffic
  - Enables controlled internet access to private services inside a VPC
