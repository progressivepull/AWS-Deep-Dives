# 3.5 A high-level view of AWS services 
 
 # üóÇÔ∏è How AWS Organizes Its Services
* AWS services are grouped into **‚Äúfunction buckets‚Äù** ‚Äîunofficial term used to represent categories based on functionality.

* Each bucket contains services with similar roles (e.g., **Compute, Storage, Database**, etc.).

* These categories help developers quickly find the tools needed for specific tasks.

* Icons for each service are visually represented in the AWS console and available in a downloadable PowerPoint icon set for presentations.
