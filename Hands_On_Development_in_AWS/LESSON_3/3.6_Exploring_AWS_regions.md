# 3.6 Exploring AWS regions 
 
# üåç Overview of AWS Global Infrastructure
* AWS is globally deployed across multiple regions and availability zones (AZs), which impact service placement and data compliance.

* *
**Regions** are distinct geographic areas with multiple AZs. Each region operates independently within the AWS Management Console.

* **Availability Zones** are isolated locations within a region, designed for fault tolerance and service resiliency.

* As of late 2022, AWS included:

    - 27 regions

    - 87 availability zones

    - 410 points of presence

    - 245 countries served

    - 115 AWS Direct Connect locations

    - Several local zones (e.g., Osaka in Japan)

# üè¢ Key Components Explained
* AWS Console Region Selector: Located in the upper-right corner of the console to switch between regions.

* Global Services: Some services like IAM and S3 are not region-constrained and appear as ‚ÄúGlobal‚Äù in the console.

* Local Zones: Special regions with only one AZ, used for specific local compliance, such as in Japan.

# ‚öñÔ∏è Legal & Regulatory Notes
* Where data is stored matters for regulatory compliance‚Äîregions and zones may align with national regulations and legal requirements.
