# 3.3 Exploring cloud providers 
 
 # ‚òÅÔ∏è Why Focus on AWS?
* AWS is the most popular cloud provider, powering 33% of hybrid and public cloud deployments (according to Flexera 2022).

* It‚Äôs widely used, intuitive, capable, and has a strong user base.

* Although not the cheapest, it's preferred for its robust features and reliability, making it the course's focal point.

# üß† Understanding ‚ÄúAs-a-Service‚Äù Models
The term ‚Äúas a service‚Äù refers to outsourcing IT responsibilities across varying layers of technology:

| Model                      | Provider's Responsibility                                      | User's Responsibility                           |
|---------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Software as a Service     | Everything from hardware to software maintenance (e.g., MySQL) | Just use the software                            |
| Platform as a Service     | Infrastructure, OS, and runtime                                | Deploy and manage applications                   |
| Infrastructure as a Service | Hardware up to virtualization (e.g., EC2)                     | Install OS and manage everything above           |


* On-premise (private cloud) is the **opposite of SaaS**, where you **own and manage the entire stack**.

# üîå Connectivity Options for Hybrid Cloud
For integrating private infrastructure with public clouds, the big providers offer **dedicated connectivity solutions**:

| Provider         | Connectivity Service     |
|------------------|--------------------------|
| AWS              | Direct Connect           |
| Microsoft Azure  | ExpressRoute             |
| Google Cloud     | Dedicated Interconnect   |

* These services allow enterprises to link their **private WANs to public clouds** via high-speed, secure connections from data centers like Equinix.

# üìö Other Cloud Provider Options
* While AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud dominate, there are **over 290 other cloud providers** listed on Wikipedia.

* These offer varying combinations of SaaS, PaaS, and IaaS to suit different needs.
