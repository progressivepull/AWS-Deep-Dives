# 3.4 A history of AWS 
 
 # 🏗️ The Birth of AWS
* In the early 2000s, Amazon was still primarily an online bookstore.

* During peak seasons (like Christmas), it scaled up infrastructure to meet demand—only to have that capacity **sit idle in off-peak months**.

* In 2003, during a company retreat (allegedly at Jeff Bezos’s summer house), someone proposed **renting out spare compute capacity** as a service to others.

* This idea sparked the concept that led to **Amazon Web Services**: renting infrastructure for others’ workloads—turning excess capacity into a revenue stream.

# 🌐 AWS’s Early Milestones

| Year           | AWS Milestone                                                                 |
|----------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ~2004          | First service: Alexa Web Information Service (API-accessible data, not the voice assistant) |
| Nov 3, 2004    | Simple Queue Service (SQS)—true first AWS release                             |
| 2006           | Launch of EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) and S3 (Simple Storage Service)         |

* **SQS** became a foundational service for distributed applications, followed by S3 for object storage, and EC2 for virtual machines.

# ⚙️ Evolution & Impact
* AWS went beyond just virtual machines—it built a vast array of services across **compute, storage, networking, security, and databases**.

* Examples:

    - Use **DynamoDB** if you want a fully managed NoSQL database.

    - Run **MySQL on EC2** if you prefer control but must manage the database yourself.

v AWS’s catalog grew to **202 services by late 2022**, with continuous updates—often highlighted by AWS evangelist **Jeff Barr**.

# 🧨 Real-World Adoption Story
* A customer (from Seattle, once supported by Cisco) had two costly data centers and wanted out.

* They transitioned everything—including directory services—to **AWS public cloud**, keeping minimal on-prem IT.

* Their move illustrates a broader shift from **owning infrastructure to leasing i**t, converting capital expenses into **operational expenses**.

# 🧱 Architecture in AWS
* Classic three-tier apps (web, app, database) can be fully deployed using AWS services:

    - **Elastic Load Balancer** fronts the application.

    - **EC2 Security Groups** and VPC ACLs handle security.

    - AWS provides the right tools for nearly every scenario—even replacing legacy data centers entirely.
