# 3.2 Why move to the cloud 
 
 # ‚òÅÔ∏è Why Companies Move to the Cloud
* **Cloud = "Someone else's computer":** You're leasing infrastructure instead of owning it.

* **Shift in strategy:** Moving from Capital Expenditure (CapEx: owning hardware) to Operational Expenditure (OpEx: paying for usage).

* **Advantages:** Flexibility, scalability, reduced upfront cost, and global accessibility.

# üìä State of Cloud (2022 vs. 2015)

| Deployment Type | 2015 (%) | 2022 (%) | Key Trend                                            |
|-----------------|----------|----------|------------------------------------------------------|
| Public Cloud    | 30       | 16       | Decrease due to security/control needs              |
| Hybrid Cloud    | 19       | 80       | Massive growth for balance of control & flexibility |
| Private Cloud   | 51       | 4        | Sharp drop as OpEx becomes favorable                |

# üåê Cloud Models Explained
* Public Cloud (e.g., AWS, Azure, Google Cloud)

    - Pay-as-you-go model

    - Shared infrastructure and massive scalability

    - Examples: EC2 for compute, S3 for storage

* Private Cloud

    - Self-owned infrastructure (data center or co-location)

    - High initial costs, tight control over security and performance

    - Suited for compliance-heavy industries

* Hybrid Cloud

    - Combines public and private

    - Secure connectivity between environments

    - Ideal for meeting both operational efficiency and regulatory requirements

# ‚úÖ Pros & Cons

| Model  | Pros                                          | Cons                                      |
|--------|-----------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Public | Elasticity, global reach, lower upfront costs | Shared resources, data location compliance |
| Private| Full control, hardware performance, compliance| High CapEx, scalability limitations        |
| Hybrid | Best of both, adaptable security and connectivity | Complex to manage, setup costs         |

# üõ†Ô∏è Other Cloud Benefits
* **Disaster Recovery:** High availability with regional redundancy

* **Software Maintenance:** SaaS model reduces operational burden

* **Security:** IAM centralizes control in public clouds

* **Cost-Efficiency:** Competitive pricing among providers

* **Decentralization:** No need to VPN into corporate network
