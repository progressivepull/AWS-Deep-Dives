# 11.6 Using Route 53 best practices 

## Amazon Route 53 Best Practices — Summary

Amazon Route 53, while a relatively simple DNS service, has several recommended best practices to improve reliability, security, and resilience.

- **Enable auto-renew for domains**  
  If Amazon is your domain registrar (for example, you registered `myawesomewebsite.com` using Route 53), enable auto-renew to prevent accidental expiration and loss of the domain.

- **Use aliases for the root (apex) domain**  
  Configure the apex domain (e.g., `myawesomewebsite.com`, not `www.myawesomewebsite.com`) to point to an **alias**, such as an Elastic Load Balancer. This avoids single points of failure that occur when pointing directly to an Elastic IP on a single EC2 instance.

- **Leverage load balancers for high availability**  
  Using an Elastic Load Balancer with multiple EC2 instances provides failover. If one instance fails, traffic continues to flow to healthy instances.

- **Implement split-view (split-horizon) DNS**  
  Use separate DNS zones for internal and external lookups. For example:
  - External: `ftp.myawesomewebsite.com`
  - Internal: `ftp.internal`  
  This ensures internal hosts resolve private IPs while external users see public IPs.

- **Avoid private records in public zones**  
  Never place private IP records in public DNS zones, as this can expose internal architecture and aid reconnaissance efforts.

- **Configure SPF records for email**  
  Implement Sender Policy Framework (SPF) records for each MX record to reduce email spoofing and improve mail delivery trust.

- **Enable Domain Transfer Lock**  
  For Route 53–registered domains, enable Domain Transfer Lock to prevent unauthorized domain transfers.

- **Use all four Route 53 delegation name servers**  
  When hosting a domain registered outside AWS (e.g., GoDaddy), configure the registrar to use all four Route 53 name servers provided and remove any others.

- **Review and optimize TTL values**  
  Set DNS Time to Live (TTL) values carefully. Long TTLs can extend outages during failures because cached records may persist until expiration.

Overall, these practices help ensure better availability, security, and operational reliability when using Amazon Route 53.
