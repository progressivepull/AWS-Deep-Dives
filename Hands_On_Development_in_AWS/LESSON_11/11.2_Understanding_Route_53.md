# 11.2 Understanding Route 53 
 
 # AWS Route 53 — Summary (Bullet Points)

- **Route 53** is Amazon’s managed **DNS (Domain Name System)** service.
- Provides a **reliable and cost-effective** way to route end users to internet applications.
- DNS translates **domain names** (e.g., `example.com`) into **IP addresses**.
- Computers ultimately communicate using **IP addresses**, not domain names.

---

## DNS Resolution Basics
- A client queries its **local DNS resolver** for a domain name.
- If unknown, the resolver performs **recursive queries** through the DNS hierarchy.
- Eventually, an **IP address** is returned to the client.
- The client then communicates **directly with the IP address**.

---

## Route 53 Core Features
- Stores mappings of **domain names to IP addresses**.
- Responds to DNS resolution requests like a traditional DNS server.
- **IPv6 compliant** with support for **AAAA records**.
- DNS record changes are replicated **globally within ~60 seconds**.
- **TTL (Time to Live)** settings still control DNS caching behavior.

---

## Private DNS
- Supports **private hosted zones** for VPCs.
- Enables internal domains (e.g., `database1.internal`).
- Resolves to **private RFC1918 IP addresses**.

---

## Health Checks & Failover
- Supports **health checks and monitoring**.
- Automatically routes traffic only to **healthy endpoints**.
- Enables **DNS failover** when an endpoint becomes unhealthy.

---

## Domain Registration
- Allows **domain registration** directly through AWS.
- Amazon acts as the **domain registrar**.

---

## Integration & Management
- Manage Route 53 via:
  - AWS Management Console
  - CLI
  - SDKs
- Integrated with:
  - **Elastic Load Balancers** (via alias records)
  - **CloudFront**
  - **S3 (Zone Apex support)**

---

## Alias Records
- Allow routing from the **root domain** (e.g., `example.com`) without `www`.
- Point directly to AWS resources like:
  - S3 buckets
  - CloudFront distributions
  - Load balancers
- Provide dynamic resolution to internal AWS endpoints.

---

## Traffic Management Features
- **Latency-based routing**  
  - Routes users to the lowest-latency region.
- **Geographic DNS**  
  - Routes users based on geographic location.
- **Weighted routing**  
  - Distributes traffic by percentage (e.g., 90/10 for A/B testing).

---

## Supported DNS Record Types
- **A** (IPv4 address)
- **AAAA** (IPv6 address)
- **CNAME** (Canonical Name)
- **NS** (Name Server)
- **PTR** (Pointer)
- **SOA** (Start of Authority)
- Supports all standard DNS record types expected in modern DNS systems
