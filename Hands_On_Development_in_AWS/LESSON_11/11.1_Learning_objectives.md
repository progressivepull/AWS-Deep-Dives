# 11.1 Learning objectives 
 # 📘 Module Four: Messaging Services — Summary

Modern applications often adopt a **microservices architecture**, which requires system components to communicate efficiently and reliably.

To enable this communication, applications rely on **queuing and messaging services** that support asynchronous interactions and system decoupling.

## Key AWS Messaging Services Introduced

### 🔹 Simple Queue Service (SQS)
- A fully managed **message queuing service**
- Enables **decoupling and scaling** of distributed systems
- Ensures reliable message delivery between components

### 🔹 Simple Notification Service (SNS)
- A **publish/subscribe (pub/sub)** messaging service
- Sends messages to **multiple subscribers simultaneously**
- Commonly used for event-driven architectures and notifications

### 🔹 Simple Email Service (SES)
- A **cloud-based email service**
- Supports **transactional and marketing emails**
- Designed for high deliverability and scalability

## Module Focus

This module emphasizes how AWS messaging services:
- Enable **reliable** communication
- Support **scalable architectures**
- Facilitate **asynchronous interactions** between microservices


* Route 53 is AWS’s fully managed Domain Name System (DNS) service.

* It translates human‑readable domain names into the infrastructure addresses applications use.

* The service integrates tightly with other AWS offerings, allowing DNS answers to reflect the real‑time health of resources.

* It supports advanced routing policies such as latency‑based, geolocation, weighted, and failover routing.
