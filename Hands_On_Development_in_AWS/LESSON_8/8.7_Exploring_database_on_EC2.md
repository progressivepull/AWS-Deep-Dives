# 8.7 Exploring database on EC2 
 
 # üß™ Exploring MySQL Database Deployment on EC2 vs. RDS

## üìò Context

In a previous demo, we deployed a Free Tier MySQL database using Amazon RDS and discussed its pricing. This guide explores an alternative: deploying MySQL directly on an EC2 instance, comparing costs, setup complexity, and operational trade-offs.

## üí∞ Cost Comparison: RDS vs. EC2

| Deployment Type | Instance Type     | Storage | Hourly Cost (USD) | Notes |
|------------------|-------------------|---------|--------------------|-------|
| **Amazon RDS**   | `db.r6g.large`     | 100 GB  | $0.231              | Includes storage, backups, maintenance |
| **Amazon EC2**   | `r6g.large`        | 100 GB  | $0.1008             | On-demand Linux instance only |

> ‚ö†Ô∏è RDS pricing includes automated backups, patching, and optional read replicas. EC2 pricing does not include storage or operational overhead.

## üõ†Ô∏è Installing MySQL on EC2 (Ubuntu)

### üîß Step-by-Step Commands

```bash
# Update package lists
sudo apt update

# Install MySQL Server
sudo apt install -y mysql-server

# Secure installation (example password: Cisco123)
sudo mysql_secure_installation

# Connect to MySQL
mysql -u root -p
# Enter password: Cisco123

# Create a sample database
CREATE DATABASE hr;
```
üìå These instructions follow the [official MySQL APT guide](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-apt-repo-quick-guide/en/) for Ubuntu.
 
# üß† Operational Considerations
## ‚úÖ RDS Advantages
* Automated backups and patching
* Multi-AZ failover support
* Read replicas
* IAM integration
* Performance Insights (optional)

## ‚ùå EC2 Trade-offs
* Manual installation and configuration
* No built-in backups or failover
* Requires OS-level patching
* You manage security and scaling
 
 # üßÆ Cost vs. Benefit Analysis
 | **Factor**              | **RDS**                             | **EC2**                             |
|-------------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Initial Cost            | Higher                              | Lower                               |
| Operational Overhead    | Minimal (managed by AWS)            | High (manual setup & ops)           |
| Scalability             | Easy (via console/API)              | Manual (resize instance)            |
| Staffing Needs          | None (fully managed)                | Requires DBA/sysadmin               |

For startups without funding or dedicated DBAs, RDS may be worth the premium for simplicity and reliability.

üßæ Final Thoughts
* EC2 is cost-effective but labor-intensive.
* RDS offers convenience and resilience at a higher price.
* Consider your team‚Äôs expertise, budget, and tolerance for operational complexity.
* As your startup grows, revisit this decision based on evolving needs.
