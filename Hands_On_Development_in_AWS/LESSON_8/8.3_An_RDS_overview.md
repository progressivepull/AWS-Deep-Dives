# 8.3 An RDS overview 

# Lesson Outline: Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS) and Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) Database Deployment
## 🧩 Introduction to Amazon RDS
* RDS as a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) offering

* AWS handles installation, OS, server infrastructure, and maintenance

## 🛠 Provisioning and Access
* User requests a database; AWS provisions and installs it

* Access via fully qualified host name using standard database clients

## 🔧 Management and Automation
* AWS manages updates, backups, read replicas, and failover

* Configuration and pricing depend on selected options
