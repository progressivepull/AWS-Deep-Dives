# 8.4 Understanding database security in Relational Database Service (RDS) 

## RDS Authentication, Authorization, and Network Access:

### Lesson Outline: RDS Access Control and Security

### üîê Authentication & Authorization Overview
* Key question: What are you authenticating access to?

    - **RDS service** (management and provisioning)

    - **Database engine** (data access)

    - **Network traffic** (connectivity and exposure)
 
# 1. Network-Level Access Control
## üõ° Security Groups
* Used to permit or deny traffic to RDS instances

* Same concept as EC2 security groups

* Must be associated with a **VPC**

* Control inbound/outbound traffic to RDS via network interfaces

* Controls the access to a DB instance
  
* Allows access from IP address ranges or Amazon EC2 instance

| Security Group Type   | Description                                                                                   |
|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| DB Security Group      | Controls access to a DB instance not in a VPC. *(Legacy, only for EC2 Classic accounts)*     |
| VPC Security Group     | - Controls access to a DB instance attached to a VPC<br>- Controls access to an EC2 instance used with a DB instance |


## üèõ EC2 Classic & DB Security Groups
* Legacy feature for accounts created before ~2013

* **DB Security Groups** used for RDS instances not attached to a VPC

* Rare and mostly deprecated, but still visible in some older accounts

# 2. AWS Service-Level Access Control
## üßæ IAM Policies
* Control access to the **RDS service itself**

* Assigned to users, groups, or roles

* Example: **AmazonRDSFullAccess** grants full RDS management permissions

### Summarizing the RDS IAM Policies

| IAM Policy Name                          | Description                                                                 |
|------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| AmazonRDSDirectoryServiceAccess          | Allow RDS to access Directory Service for domain-joined DB instances        |
| AmazonRDSEnhancedMonitoringRole          | Provides access to CloudWatch for RDS Enhanced Monitoring                   |
| AmazonRDSFullAccess                      | Provides full access to Amazon RDS via AWS Management Console               |
| AmazonRDSReadOnlyAccess                  | Provides read-only access to Amazon RDS via AWS Management Console          |
| AmazonRDSDescribeRDS                     | Allow QuickSight to describe the RDS service                               |
| CloudWatchLogsAuthorizationRole          | Default policy for the Amazon RDS role                                     |


# 3. Database-Level Access Control
## üîë Engine-Specific Credentials
* Access to actual data requires database usernames and passwords

* Managed separately from IAM

* Typically provisioned by a **database administrator**
