# 8.4 Understanding database security in Relational Database Service (RDS) 

## RDS Authentication, Authorization, and Network Access:

### Lesson Outline: RDS Access Control and Security

### 🔐 Authentication & Authorization Overview
* Key question: What are you authenticating access to?

    - **RDS service** (management and provisioning)

    - **Database engine** (data access)

    - **Network traffic** (connectivity and exposure)
 
# 1. Network-Level Access Control
## 🛡 Security Groups
* Used to permit or deny traffic to RDS instances

* Same concept as EC2 security groups

* Must be associated with a **VPC**

* Control inbound/outbound traffic to RDS via network interfaces

## 🏛 EC2 Classic & DB Security Groups
* Legacy feature for accounts created before ~2013

* **DB Security Groups** used for RDS instances not attached to a VPC

* Rare and mostly deprecated, but still visible in some older accounts

# 2. AWS Service-Level Access Control
## 🧾 IAM Policies
* Control access to the **RDS service itself**

* Assigned to users, groups, or roles

* Example: **AmazonRDSFullAccess** grants full RDS management permissions

# 3. Database-Level Access Control
## 🔑 Engine-Specific Credentials
* Access to actual data requires database usernames and passwords

* Managed separately from IAM

* Typically provisioned by a **database administrator**
