# 8.8 Using RDS best practices 
 
 # AWS RDS Best Practices Guide

This document outlines best practices for securely and efficiently using Amazon Web Services (AWS) Relational Database Service (RDS).

---

## 🔐 Identity and Access Management (IAM)

- Use IAM to control access to RDS resources.
- Apply the **principle of least privilege** when assigning IAM policies.
- Regularly audit IAM roles and permissions for unnecessary access.

---

## 🌐 Network Security

- Configure **security groups** to restrict inbound traffic to trusted IP addresses.
- Use **SSL/TLS** to encrypt connections to your RDS instance.
  - Most RDS engines have SSL enabled by default.
- Enable **RDS encryption** for:
  - Database instances
  - Automated backups
  - Snapshots
  - Read replicas

---

## 🛡️ Database Engine Security

- Leverage built-in security features of your chosen database engine.
  - Examples: user roles, access controls, audit logs
- Regularly patch and update your database engine to mitigate vulnerabilities.

---

## 📊 Monitoring and Metrics

- Monitor **CPU**, **memory**, and **storage** usage via:
  - RDS Console
  - Amazon CloudWatch
- Set up **CloudWatch alarms** to notify you of threshold breaches or anomalies.

---

## 📈 Scalability

- Scale your database manually or enable **automatic storage scaling**.
  - Prevents disk space exhaustion during peak usage periods.

---

## 💾 Backup Strategy

- Enable **automatic backups**.
- Schedule the **backup window** during periods of low I/O activity.
- Ensure backups are **encrypted at rest**.

---

## 🌍 DNS and TTL Configuration

- When connecting via **Amazon DNS (ADNS)**:
  - Set **TTL (Time-To-Live)** to less than **30 seconds**.
  - Ensures rapid DNS propagation during failover events.

---

## 🔄 High Availability and Failover Testing

- Regularly **test failover** scenarios:
  - Measure recovery time
  - Assess application resilience
  - Validate DNS resolution and connection retries

| Scalability           | Enable auto-scaling for storage                    |
| Backups               | Automatic, encrypted, scheduled during low I/O     |
| DNS & TTL             | TTL < 30s for ADNS connections                     |
| Failover              | Test and measure recovery time                     |
