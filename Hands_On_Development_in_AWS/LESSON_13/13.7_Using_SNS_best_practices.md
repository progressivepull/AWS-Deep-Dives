# 13.7 Using SNS best practices 
 
- Follow Amazon SES best practices when sending email
- Ask yourself: **“Would I personally want to receive this message?”**
- Monitor sender reputation closely, especially in high-risk industries such as:
  - Home mortgage
  - Credit and financial services
  - Adult entertainment
- Use a **thoughtful “From” address**
  - Avoid using **no-reply** addresses
  - Allow recipients a way to respond
- Use **subdomains** for different email purposes, for example:
  - `orders.example.com`
  - `marketing.example.com`
  - Reply address like `support@orders.example.com`
- Ensure **WHOIS information** for your domain is accurate
  - Allows abuse or compliance contacts to reach you
- Authenticate your domain using:
  - **SPF**
  - **Sender ID**
- Sign outgoing emails with **DKIM**
  - Confirms the message is sent by you
  - Builds trust with receiving mail servers
- Test authentication by:
  - Sending emails to yourself
  - Reviewing email headers for SPF/DKIM validation
- Comply with all **anti-spam and marketing laws**
  - Follow regulations for the **recipient’s region**, not just where emails are sent from
