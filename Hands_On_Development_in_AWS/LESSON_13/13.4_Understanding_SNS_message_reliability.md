# 13.4 Understanding SNS message reliability 
 
 - Similar to other AWS services (such as DynamoDB, S3, and SQS), Amazon SNS uses a replication period to ensure data reliability.
- Messages published to an SNS topic are replicated across multiple Availability Zones.
- This replication ensures message durability even if a single Availability Zone fails.
- SNS does **not** acknowledge receipt of a published message until replication across Availability Zones is complete.
- When the SNS API confirms message receipt, the message is already stored in multiple Availability Zones.
- Durability is built in, so no additional action is required by the user.
- Delivery status logging is available for the following endpoint types:
  - Application endpoints
  - HTTP endpoints
  - Lambda
  - SQS
- Delivery status logging is **not** available for email or SMS endpoints, and delivery cannot be guaranteed for those methods.
- Delivery status logs for supported endpoints are sent to CloudWatch Logs.
- SNS is tightly integrated with Amazon CloudWatch.
- SNS metrics are published to CloudWatch every five minutes.
- Metrics are only collected for **active topics**, defined as topics with activity in the last six hours.
- CloudWatch monitoring for SNS topics is provided at no additional cost.
