# AppSync
This example uses an AppSync GraphQL API to front-end data query and manipulation in a DynamoDB table.

## Table Creation
This example requires a DynamoDB table.  The 1_create_table.py script can be used to create the table.
```
$ python3 1_create_table.py 

> Current tables
    CarsNE1
    Olympics
    TestGlobal
    people
    student

> Creating table
    Created table ARN: arn:aws:dynamodb:us-east-2:146868985163:table/AppSyncTest

> Waiting for table state: ACTIVE
    Check 0: CREATING
    Check 1: CREATING
    Check 2: CREATING
    Check 3: CREATING
    Check 4: CREATING
    Check 5: ACTIVE

> Inserting 1 item into AppSyncTest
    The item:
    {"id": {"N": "1"}, "make": {"S": "Mazda"}, "model": {"S": "RX-7"}, "year": {"N": "1982"}}

> Scanning table for count
    1 item(s) in the new table:
    {"model": {"S": "RX-7"}, "year": {"N": "1982"}, "id": {"N": "1"}, "make": {"S": "Mazda"}}

$
```

✔ Help improve Amplify CLI by sharing non sensitive configurations on failures (y/N) · no
Deployment state saved successfully.
✔ Initialized provider successfully.
✅ Initialized your environment successfully.

Your project has been successfully initialized and connected to the cloud!

Some next steps:
"amplify status" will show you what you've added already and if it's locally configured or deployed
"amplify add <category>" will allow you to add features like user login or a backend API
"amplify push" will build all your local backend resources and provision it in the cloud
"amplify console" to open the Amplify Console and view your project status
"amplify publish" will build all your local backend and frontend resources (if you have hosting category added) and provision it in the cloud

Pro tip:
Try "amplify add api" to create a backend API and then "amplify push" to deploy everything
$
```


## Amplify Add API
```
$  amplify add codegen --apiId d6yopjippzbhjnrvhinp4xyely

? Choose the code generation language target javascript
? Enter the file name pattern of graphql queries, mutations and subscriptions src/graphql/**/*.js
? Do you want to generate/update all possible GraphQL operations - queries, mutations and subscriptions Yes
? Enter maximum statement depth [increase from default if your schema is deeply nested] 2
✔ Downloaded the schema
