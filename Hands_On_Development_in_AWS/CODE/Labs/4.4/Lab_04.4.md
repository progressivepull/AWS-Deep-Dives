**Demo Outline for Lesson 4.4: Preventing Overfitting and Underfitting**

----------

**Objective:**

This lab will demonstrate **overfitting** and **underfitting**, their causes, and how to prevent them using techniques like regularization, dropout, early stopping, and appropriate model complexity. It will include a hands-on demonstration using a SageMaker training job.

Underfitting: 
-   Model is too simple 
-   High bias, low variance 
-   Poor performance on both training and testing data 
-   Example: Trying to fit a straight line to data that is clearly curved 

Overfitting: 
-   Model is too complex 
-   Low bias, high variance 
-   Excellent performance on training data, poor performance on new data 
-   Example: A model that memorizes the training data exactly, including noise 

----------

**1. Demo Setup**

**Prerequisites:**

-   AWS account with SageMaker Studio access
-   Preprocessed dataset uploaded to Amazon S3 (e.g., a regression or classification problem)
-   Familiarity with ML concepts (training, validation, evaluation)

**Tools and Resources:**

-   Built-in algorithm (e.g., **XGBoost**, **Linear Learner**, or **Neural Networks with TensorFlow**)
-   Preprocessed training and validation datasets

----------

**2. Step-by-Step Demonstration**

----------

**Step 1: Explain Overfitting and Underfitting**

1.  **Overfitting:** When the model performs well on training data but poorly on validation or test data due to memorization of noise and details.
2.  **Underfitting:** When the model is too simple and fails to capture the underlying patterns of the data, resulting in poor performance on both training and validation sets.
3.  **Causes:**

-   **Overfitting:** Complex models, insufficient training data, or lack of regularization.
-   **Underfitting:** Oversimplified models, insufficient training iterations, or lack of expressive features.

----------

**Step 2: Load Dataset and Set Up Training Job**

1.  **Dataset:** Use a sample dataset, such as predicting house prices or customer purchases.
2.  **Upload training and validation data** to Amazon S3:

-   Training data: s3://my-bucket/training-data/training.csv
-   Validation data: s3://my-bucket/validation-data/validation.csv

----------

**Step 3: Set Up a Baseline Training Job**

1.  In SageMaker Studio, create a **new training job** using the **XGBoost** algorithm.
2.  Specify the basic configuration:

-   Input data paths: Training and validation datasets in S3
-   Output location: s3://my-bucket/model-output/
-   Objective metric: validation:rmse (for regression) or validation:accuracy (for classification)

4.  Set default or minimal hyperparameters to simulate underfitting:

-   max_depth = 2 (a shallow tree)
-   num_round = 10 (insufficient boosting iterations)

6.  **Launch the baseline training job**.

----------

**Step 4: Evaluate the Baseline Model**

1.  Review the training and validation metrics in SageMaker Studio:

-   Look for signs of **underfitting** (low training and validation accuracy or high RMSE).

3.  Save these baseline metrics for comparison with improved models.

----------

**Step 5: Address Underfitting (Model Complexity and Iterations)**

1.  Modify the model configuration to make it more expressive:

-   **Increase depth of the tree:** Set max_depth = 6
-   **Increase training rounds:** Set num_round = 100

3.  Re-run the training job and monitor the validation performance.

----------

**Step 6: Simulate Overfitting**

1.  Create another training job with overly complex settings to simulate overfitting:

-   **Set very high tree depth:**  max_depth = 12
-   **High number of boosting rounds:**  num_round = 500

3.  Monitor the model’s performance:

-   Check the training accuracy or RMSE (likely high performance).
-   Compare it with validation accuracy or RMSE (likely poor performance).

----------

**Step 7: Prevent Overfitting with Regularization**

1.  Introduce **L1 and L2 regularization** to constrain the model’s complexity:
-   Set lambda (L2 regularization) and alpha (L1 regularization).

```
{
  "lambda": "1",
  "alpha": "0.5"
}
```

2.  (Optional) For neural networks, introduce **dropout layers** to randomly deactivate neurons and reduce overfitting.

-   Example: Dropout rate of 0.3 in a deep learning model using TensorFlow.

```
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense, Dropout
model = Sequential([
  Dense(128, activation='relu'),
  Dropout(0.3),
  Dense(64, activation='relu'),
  Dropout(0.3),
  Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])
```
----------

**Step 8: Implement Early Stopping**

1.  Enable **early stopping** to prevent overfitting by terminating training when performance on the validation set stops improving.
2.  Example configuration in **XGBoost**:
```
{
  "early_stopping_rounds": "10"
}
```

3.  Monitor the training process and observe how early stopping prevents the model from overtraining.

----------

**Step 9: Compare Results**

1.  Compare the performance of different models based on:

-   Training accuracy vs. validation accuracy
-   RMSE or another relevant metric

3.  Discuss how the model that balances complexity and regularization achieves better performance without overfitting or underfitting.

----------

**3. Wrap-Up Discussion**

**Key Takeaways:**

-   Overfitting occurs when the model is too complex, while underfitting happens when the model is too simple.
-   Regularization techniques like **L1/L2 regularization**, **dropout**, and **early stopping** help mitigate overfitting.
-   Proper hyperparameter tuning and monitoring are crucial to balancing the model’s performance.
