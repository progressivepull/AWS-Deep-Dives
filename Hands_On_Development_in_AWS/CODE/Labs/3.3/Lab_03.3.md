**Demo Outline for Lesson 3.3: Managing SageMaker Feature Store**

----------

**Objective:**

This lab will demonstrate creating, ingesting, and retrieving features using the **SageMaker Feature Store**. The key tasks will include setting up feature groups, ingesting data, querying features, and using them in machine learning models.

----------

**1. Demo Setup**

**Prerequisites:**

-   AWS account access
-   SageMaker Studio environment set up
-   CSV dataset from the course repository

----------

**2. Step-by-Step Demonstration**

----------

**Step 1: Open SageMaker Studio and Launch SageMaker Feature Store**

1.  Navigate to **SageMaker Studio** and open the **Feature Store UI** in Data > Feature Store.
2.  Review the key purpose of the Feature Storeâ€”storing and managing ML features for consistent use in training and inference.

----------

**Step 2: Create a Feature Group**

1.  Go to **Feature Store > Create Feature Group**.
2.  Define the following key configurations:

-   **Feature group name:** For example, HomeSales
-   **Event time column:** A timestamp to keep track of when features are recorded (e.g., `timestamp`)
-   **Record identifier:** Choose a unique identifier like `id`
-   **Feature definitions:** Specify column names and data types (e.g., Age as an integer, Income as a float)

4. Note **online** vs **offline** storage options.
5.  Click **Create** to set up the feature group.

----------

**Step 3: Ingest Data into the Feature Store**

1.  Import the preprocessed dataset using one of the following methods:

-   SageMaker Data Wrangler
-   A SageMaker Python SDK script (see example below)

2.  Example Python code to ingest data:
```
import boto3
from sagemaker.feature_store.feature_group import FeatureGroup

# Set up the feature group
feature_group = FeatureGroup(name="HomeSales", sagemaker_session=session)

# Load the preprocessed data (assume data is in a pandas DataFrame)
import pandas as pd
data = pd.read_csv("sample_home_sales_dataset_300.csv")

# Ingest data into the feature store
feature_group.ingest(data_frame=data, max_workers=3, wait=True)
```
3.  Verify that the data has been successfully ingested into the feature store.

----------

**Step 4: Explore Features in the Feature Store**

1.  Use the **SageMaker Studio UI** to query and explore feature groups:

-   View the list of features.
-   Check their types, descriptions, and recent values.

----------

**Step 5: Online Store**

1.  Create and ingest data into an online feature group using the provided scripts. 

----------

**Step 6: Monitor and Maintain the Feature Store**

1.  Update existing feature group, add area feature.
