# 23.5 Using ECS best practices 
 
- **Container Image Design**
  - Keep container images **static** and as **small as possible**
  - Use **one application process per image**
  - Remove unnecessary binaries to reduce attack surface

- **Logging**
  - Write logs to **stdout** and **stderr**
  - Enables centralized log collection in **CloudWatch Logs**

- **IAM and Security**
  - Use a **dedicated IAM role per task definition**
  - Follow the **principle of least privilege**
  - Avoid running containers as the **root user**

- **Network Access**
  - Allow inbound and outbound internet access **only when required**
  - Restrict networking to reduce security risks

- **Monitoring and Observability**
  - Enable **CloudWatch Container Insights**
  - Use **AWS X-Ray** for tracing
  - Use **VPC Flow Logs** to monitor network traffic

- **Shared Responsibility Model**
  - AWS secures the cloud infrastructure
  - You are responsible for **security in the cloud**
  - Secure everything you deploy within AWS

- **Encryption**
  - Use **AWS Key Management Service (KMS)**
  - Encrypt **ephemeral storage** when using Fargate

- **Vulnerability Management**
  - Scan container images for vulnerabilities
  - ECS integrates with **Clair** for image scanning
  - Review scan results and address findings

- **Operational Guidance**
  - Do not rely solely on a short best-practices list
  - Review the official **Amazon ECS Best Practices Guide**
  - Guide is extensive (~100+ pages) and provides deep operational insight

- **Key Takeaway**
  - ECS security and reliability depend on disciplined image design, IAM controls, and monitoring
  - Following best practices reduces risk and improves containerized workload stability
