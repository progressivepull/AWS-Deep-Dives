# 14.5 Using SES best practices 
 
 # Amazon SES Best Practices — Summary

Amazon provides several recommended best practices to help maintain a strong sending reputation and ensure reliable email delivery when using Amazon SES.

## Email Content & Intent
- Always ask: **“Would I personally want to receive this message?”**
- Avoid sending content that may feel spammy or unwanted to recipients.

## Reputation Management
- Closely monitor your sending reputation, especially if operating in high-risk industries such as:
  - Home mortgage
  - Credit and finance
  - Adult entertainment
- These industries are more prone to spam complaints and scrutiny.

## Sender Address Best Practices
- Use a **thoughtful and monitored “From” address**.
- **Do not use a `no-reply` address**; Amazon explicitly recommends against it.
- Allow recipients to reply easily to build trust and engagement.

## Domain & Subdomain Strategy
- Use **subdomains** for different email purposes:
  - `orders.example.com`
  - `marketing.example.com`
- Example reply address:
  - `support@orders.example.com`
- This helps organize email traffic and isolate reputation issues.

## WHOIS Information
- Ensure your domain’s **WHOIS information is accurate and up to date**.
- This allows abuse or compliance teams to contact you if needed.

## Email Authentication
- **Authenticate your domain** using:
  - SPF and SenderID
  - DKIM signing
- These measures:
  - Verify that emails are truly sent by you
  - Increase trust with receiving mail servers
  - Improve deliverability

## Testing Authentication
- Send test emails to yourself.
- Inspect the **email headers** to confirm SPF, DKIM, and authentication status.

## Legal Compliance
- Comply with all **anti-spam and marketing laws**.
- Follow regulations based on **where recipients are located**, not just where emails are sent from.

## Final Note
These are **Amazon-recommended best practices**, not personal opinions. Following them helps protect your SES reputation, improve deliverability, and maintain compliance across regions.
