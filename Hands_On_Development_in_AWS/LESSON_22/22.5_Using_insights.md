- **Purpose of CloudWatch Logs Insights**
  - Enables querying and analysis of log data
  - Uses a dedicated query language to extract insights from logs

- **Example Setup**

* [cmd_python_push_apache_logs_to_cloudwatch.png](./IMAGES/22.5_Using_insights/cmd_python_push_apache_logs_to_cloudwatch.png)

  - Used an application to push **Apache logs** into CloudWatch
  - Uploaded approximately **5,000 log messages**
  - Logs stored in a log group named **Apache Logs Insights Demo**
  - Multiple log streams created within the log group

- **Viewing Logs**
  - Verified log ingestion by opening the most recent log stream
  - Observed thousands of log entries updating in real time

- **Using Logs Insights**
  - Navigated to **CloudWatch → Logs Insights**
  - Selected one or more log groups for querying
  - Default query includes:
    - Timestamp
    - Message fields
    - Result limit

- **Query Capabilities**
  - Supports filtering, sorting, and limiting results
  - Example filter:
    - Exclude messages containing a specific keyword (e.g., `CMS`)
  - Queries can be modified interactively and re-run

- **Query Help**
  - Built-in **Query Help** provides examples and syntax guidance
  - Includes commands such as:
    - `filter`
    - `stats`
    - `sort`
    - `limit`

- **Query Results**
  - Queries scan log data and return matched records
  - Shows:
    - Number of records scanned
    - Execution time
    - Number of matched results
  - Removing filters returns full data set

- **Advanced Usage**
  - Query across **multiple log groups** simultaneously
  - Aggregate and correlate log data
  - Extract meaningful patterns from large log volumes

- **Key Takeaway**
  - CloudWatch Logs Insights is a powerful tool for log analysis
  - Helps quickly filter and understand large datasets
  - Essential for troubleshooting and operational visibility
