# 22.2 Understanding CloudWatch 
 
- **CloudWatch Overview**
  - CloudWatch is more than a logging service
  - Provides full **observability** for:
    - AWS resources
    - Applications running in AWS
    - On-premises systems

- **CloudWatch Data Sources**
  - Supports near real-time collection of logs and metrics
  - Metrics are often published at fixed intervals (e.g., every 5 minutes)
  - Supports data from over **70 AWS services**

- **Log Types**
  - **Vended logs**
    - Logs published by AWS services on behalf of customers
  - **Service logs**
    - Logs generated by services such as Lambda (stdout/stderr)
  - **Custom logs**
    - Application-generated logs sent via SDKs or agents

- **CloudWatch Agent**
  - Installed on servers to collect system and application logs
  - Supports Windows and many Linux distributions
  - Can be installed:
    - Manually
    - Via **AWS Systems Manager**
  - Enables monitoring of on-premises resources

- **Feature Categories**
  - Collection
  - Monitoring
  - Acting on data
  - Analytics
  - Compliance and security

- **Monitoring Capabilities**
  - Dashboards with charts and graphs
  - Side-by-side metric comparisons
  - Standard and high-resolution alarms
  - Composite alarms for correlated metrics

- **Application Observability**
  - Correlates logs and metrics to assess application health
  - Machine learning–based anomaly detection
  - **ServiceLens**
    - Combines metrics, logs, and X-Ray traces
  - **Synthetics**
    - Automated health checks and alerts
  - **RUM (Real User Monitoring)**
    - Client-side performance monitoring
    - Requires application instrumentation

- **Automated Actions**
  - Trigger actions based on alarms or events
  - Examples:
    - Auto Scaling adjustments
    - Disk capacity increases
    - Notifications via SNS
  - **CloudWatch Events**
    - Rule-based automation for matched conditions
  - Automation for container services supported

- **Analytics Features**
  - **CloudWatch Logs Insights**
    - Query language for analyzing log data
  - **Lambda Insights**
    - Advanced visibility into Lambda performance
  - **Evidently**
    - Feature experimentation and impact analysis before rollout

- **Compliance and Security**
  - Integrated with **IAM** for fine-grained access control
  - Compliant with:
    - PCI (Payment Card Industry)
    - FedRAMP
  - Data encryption:
    - In transit
    - At rest using **AWS KMS**

- **Key Takeaway**
  - CloudWatch is a comprehensive observability platform
  - Supports monitoring, analytics, automation, and compliance across AWS and on-prem environments
