# 22.3 Exploring logs 
 
- **Purpose of the Demo**
  - Demonstrates **CloudWatch Logs** as a core CloudWatch feature
  - Shows how an application can write logs to CloudWatch using an **AWS SDK**

- **CloudWatch Logs Basics**
  - Logs are organized into:
    - **Log groups**
    - **Log streams**
  - AWS Lambda automatically writes standard output to CloudWatch Logs
    - Log group named after the function
    - New log streams created per deployment or execution

- **Example Application**
  - Located in the `CloudWatch/1-LogsViaSDK` directory
  - Uses an SDK-based approach to send logs to CloudWatch
  - Configuration loaded from `config.json`

- **Application Workflow**
  - Creates a **CloudWatch Logs client**
  - Checks if the log group exists
    - Creates it if it does not
  - Creates a new log stream
    - Uses **epoch time** to ensure unique stream names

- **Sequence Token Handling**
  - First log entry does **not** require a sequence token
  - Subsequent log entries require the **next_sequence_token**
  - Token is extracted from the previous response and reused
  - Ensures correct ordering of log events

- **Logging Behavior**
  - Writes an initial log message to initialize the stream
  - Continuously sends log messages with incrementing values
  - Handles clean shutdown using a Ctrl+C signal catcher

- **Verification in CloudWatch**
  - Log group appears in **CloudWatch Logs**
  - Log stream is visible and contains real-time log entries
  - Logs can be viewed, filtered, and searched

- **Execution Results**
  - Logs stream updates live in the CloudWatch console
  - Re-running the application creates a new log stream
  - Behavior mirrors Lambda’s log stream creation model

- **Key Takeaway**
  - Applications can send logs directly to CloudWatch using SDKs
  - CloudWatch Logs enables centralized log storage and analysis
  - Logs can later be queried, filtered, and used for alerting
