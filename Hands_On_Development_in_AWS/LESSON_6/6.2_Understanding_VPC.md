# 6.2 Understanding VPC 
 
 # üåê What Is a VPC?
A **Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)** is a logically isolated network environment within AWS that mimics a traditional data center‚Äîbut runs in the cloud.

* Virtual: You can‚Äôt physically touch it

* Private: Segregated from other AWS customers

* Cloud: Hosted on AWS infrastructure (i.e., someone else‚Äôs computer)

# üß± Core VPC Components
 
 | Component            | Description                                                       |
|----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Subnets              | Segments of IP ranges within Availability Zones                   |
| Route Tables         | Define traffic flow between subnets and gateways                  |
| Internet Gateway     | Enables public internet access for VPC resources                  |
| NAT Gateway          | Allows private instances to access the internet securely          |
| Security Groups      | Stateful firewalls attached to network interfaces                 |
| Network ACLs (NACLs) | Stateless firewalls applied at the subnet level                   |


# üîê Security: Stateful vs Stateless

| Feature         | Security Groups        | NACLs                   |
|-----------------|------------------------|--------------------------|
| State Tracking  | ‚úÖ Yes (stateful)       | ‚ùå No (stateless)        |
| Use Case        | Instance-level control | Subnet-level control     |
| Ingress/Egress  | Both supported         | Both supported           |


* **Security Groups:** Automatically allow return traffic

* **NACLs:** Require explicit rules for both directions

# üñß Networking Behavior
* **Private IPs:** Assigned from subnet range; sticky across reboots

* **Public IPs:** Assigned via Internet Gateway or Elastic IP

* **Multiple Interfaces:** EC2 instances can have multiple ENIs across subnets

* **IPv6 Support:** Available and configurable

# üîå Service Integration with VPC
Services that can be launched into or attached to a VPC include:

* **EC2** (Elastic Compute Cloud)

* *** **RDS** (Relational Database Service)

* **Elastic Load Balancing**

* **Elastic IPs**

* **VPN & Direct Connect**

‚û°Ô∏è Example: EC2 app securely connects to RDS MySQL via VPC, avoiding public exposure.

# üí∞ Pricing & Limits
* **VPC itself is free**

* Charges apply for attached resources (e.g., EC2, NAT Gateway, Elastic IPs)

* **Elastic IPs** incur charges when not attached to an instance

### üî¢ Soft Limits (as of Sep 2022)

| Resource           | Limit per Region     |
|--------------------|----------------------|
| VPCs               | 5                    |
| Subnets per VPC    | 200                  |
| Elastic IPs        | 5                    |
| NACLs              | 200                  |
| NACL Rules         | 20 per NACL          |

‚û°Ô∏è Limits are adjustable via support requests

# üåç VPC Scope & Architecture
* **VPCs span a region**

* **Subnets reside in Availability Zones**

* **Routing between subnets** is handled by a logical router

* **External connectivity** via:

    - Internet Gateway

    - NAT Gateway

    - Virtual Private Gateway

    - Direct Connect (not shown)
