# 6.4 Understanding default VPC 

#🏗️ What Is a Default VPC?
* A **Default VPC** is automatically created in every AWS region.

* It allows you to launch EC2 instances without manually configuring networking.

* It includes:

    - One VPC per region

    - One subnet per Availability Zone

    - A main route table

    - An internet gateway

    - Auto-assigned public IPs for EC2 instances

#🌐 Default VPC Structure 
 
| Component        | Details                                                       |
|------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| VPC CIDR Block   | Typically 172.31.0.0/16                                        |
| Subnets          | One per Availability Zone (e.g., 172.31.0.0/20, 172.31.16.0/20, etc.) |
| Route Table      | Main route table with default routing rules                   |

* Local route (172.31.0.0/16)

* Default route (0.0.0.0/0) to internet gateway | | **Internet Gateway** | Enables public internet access | | **Auto-Assign Public IP** | Enabled by default for all subnets |

# 📦 EC2 Launch Behavior
* EC2 instances must be launched into a subnet within a VPC.

* In a default VPC:

    - Subnets auto-assign public IPv4 addresses

    - EC2 instances get both public and private IPs

    - Internet gateway handles address translation

# 🔄 Routing Logic
* **Local Traffic:** Routed within the VPC if destination IP is within 172.31.0.0/16

* **External Traffic:** Routed to internet gateway via default route (0.0.0.0/0)

* **Main Route Table:** Automatically associated with all subnets unless explicitly overridden

# 🧮 Subnetting Example
* CIDR: 172.31.0.0/16

* Subnets: /20 blocks like 172.31.0.0/20, 172.31.16.0/20, 172.31.32.0/20

* Each /20 subnet supports ~4,091 host IPs

# 💡 Key Notes
* **No NAT Gateway** is created by default (NAT incurs cost)

* **Elastic IPs** can be manually assigned if needed

* **Route 53** can be used with Elastic IPs for stable DNS records

* Default VPC is ideal for quick deployments but may lack fine-grained control
