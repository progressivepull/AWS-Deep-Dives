# 6.3 Exploring networking and security 
 
# üß† VPC Architecture Recap
* **VPC** spans an entire AWS region.

* **Subnets** reside in individual Availability Zones.

* **Logical Router** connects subnets and routes traffic via **Route Tables**.

* **Internet Gateway** enables external connectivity.

# üß© Core Networking Components

| Component            | Description                                                                 |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Subnets              | RFC 1918 private IP ranges (e.g., 10.0.0.0/8, 172.16.0.0/12, 192.168.0.0/16) |
| CIDR Block           | Defines the IP range for the VPC and its subnets                            |
| Route Tables         | Control traffic flow: ‚ÄúIf you want to get to X, go via Y‚Äù                   |
| Main Route Table     | Default route table; cannot be deleted but can be replaced                  |
| Security Groups      | Stateful firewalls applied to EC2 and load balancers                        |
| Network ACLs (NACLs) | Stateless firewalls applied at the subnet level                             |

# üîê Security Controls

| Feature              | Security Groups        | NACLs                   |
|----------------------|------------------------|--------------------------|
| State Tracking       | ‚úÖ Yes (stateful)       | ‚ùå No (stateless)        |
| Application Level    | EC2, Load Balancers    | Subnets                 |
| Ingress/Egress Rules | Supported              | Supported               |


* **Security Groups:** Automatically allow return traffic

* **NACLs:** Require explicit rules for both directions

# üåç Connectivity Options

| Method               | Purpose                                                       |
|----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| Internet Gateway     | One-to-one public IP mapping for internet access              |
| NAT Gateway          | Many-to-one mapping for outbound-only internet access         |
| Egress-Only Gateway  | IPv6-only outbound internet access                            |
| IPSec VPN Gateway    | Secure tunnel between on-prem and VPC                         |
| VPC Peering          | Connect two VPCs (non-overlapping CIDRs)                      |
| Direct Connect       | Dedicated private link via providers like Equinix             |

# üìå Elastic IPs & Route 53
* **Elastic IPs:** Static public IPs that can be reassigned across instances

* **Route 53:** AWS‚Äôs managed DNS service; works well with Elastic IPs for stable DNS records

# üßÆ Subnetting Example
* **VPC CIDR:** 172.31.0.0/16

* **Subnets:**

    - 172.31.0.0/20

    - 172.31.16.0/20

* Both subnets fit within the VPC‚Äôs CIDR block

# üîÑ Routing Behavior
* Subnets without explicit route table association default to the main route table

* Route tables define how traffic flows between subnets and external gateways
