# 4.4 Understanding AWS CLI vs. web GUI 
 
 # 🌐 AWS Access Methods Overview

Primary Ways to Access AWS:

* **Web Console** – Browser-based interface at console.aws.amazon.com

* **Command Line Interface (CLI)** – Programmatic access via shell scripts or terminal

* **Software Development Kits (SDKs)** – Code-level integration for AWS service interaction

* **Query API** – Underlying API used by CLI, SDKs, and Web Console

# 🧰 Tools Used in This Course

* Web Console
* CLI
* SDK 
* 
➡️ All three will be used for demonstrations and examples.

# 🖥️ Web Console Highlights
* Access via browser → Login with IAM user credentials

* Navigate services via **Services** menu or search bar

* Example: Access EC2 → View, launch, or manage instances

* Region selector (top-right) filters resources by AWS region

    - EC2 is region-specific (e.g., Northern California vs. Ohio)

    - S3 and IAM are **global services** (not region-constrained in the console)

# 📍 Region vs. Global Services

| Service | Region-Constrained | Console Scope     |
|---------|--------------------|-------------------|
| EC2     | ✅ Yes             | Region-specific   |
| S3      | ✅ Buckets per region, global console | Global            |
| IAM     | ❌ No              | Global            |

# 🔐 IAM User Login

* IAM user with admin privileges used for course activities

* Root user login avoided for security best practices

* IAM vs. Root user distinction will be covered in IAM section
