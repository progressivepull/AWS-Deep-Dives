# 4.4 Understanding AWS CLI vs. web GUI 
 
 # üåê AWS Access Methods Overview

Primary Ways to Access AWS:

* **Web Console** ‚Äì Browser-based interface at console.aws.amazon.com

* **Command Line Interface (CLI)** ‚Äì Programmatic access via shell scripts or terminal

* **Software Development Kits (SDKs)** ‚Äì Code-level integration for AWS service interaction

* **Query API** ‚Äì Underlying API used by CLI, SDKs, and Web Console

# üß∞ Tools Used in This Course

* Web Console
* CLI
* SDK 

‚û°Ô∏è All three will be used for demonstrations and examples.

# üñ•Ô∏è Web Console Highlights
* Access via browser ‚Üí Login with IAM user credentials

* Navigate services via **Services** menu or search bar

* Example: Access EC2 ‚Üí View, launch, or manage instances

* Region selector (top-right) filters resources by AWS region

    - EC2 is region-specific (e.g., Northern California vs. Ohio)

    - S3 and IAM are **global services** (not region-constrained in the console)

# üìç Region vs. Global Services

| Service | Region-Constrained | Console Scope     |
|---------|--------------------|-------------------|
| EC2     | ‚úÖ Yes             | Region-specific   |
| S3      | ‚úÖ Buckets per region, global console | Global            |
| IAM     | ‚ùå No              | Global            |

# üîê IAM User Login

* IAM user with admin privileges used for course activities

* Root user login avoided for security best practices

* IAM vs. Root user distinction will be covered in IAM section

# AWS Regions and Availability Zones

## AWS Region
- **Definition**:  
  An **AWS Region** is a broad geographic area that contains multiple, isolated data centers known as Availability Zones (AZs).
- **Purpose**:  
  Designed to provide:
  - **Fault tolerance**  
  - **Disaster recovery**  
- **Example**:  
  `us-east-1` (N. Virginia), `eu-west-1` (Ireland)

---

## AWS Availability Zone (AZ)
- **Definition**:  
  An **Availability Zone (AZ)** is a distinct, isolated data center within an AWS Region.  
- **Key Characteristics**:
  - Independent **power**, **networking**, and **cooling**
  - **Low-latency connections** between AZs within the same region
- **Purpose**:  
  Enables **high availability** and **fault tolerance** for workloads by distributing resources across multiple AZs.

---

## Summary
- **Region** = Geographic area with multiple AZs.  
- **Availability Zone** = Isolated data center inside a region.  
- Together, they ensure **resilience**, **scalability**, and **disaster recovery** in AWS cloud infrastructure.
