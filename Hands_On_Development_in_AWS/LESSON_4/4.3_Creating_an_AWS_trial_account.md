# 👤 IAM User Creation (Best Practice)
* Open IAM service → Add user

* Username: generic

* Access type: AWS Management Console

* Set custom password (disable forced reset)

* Assign **AdministratorAccess** policy

* Skip tags → Review → Create user

# 🔗 IAM Sign-In URL & Alias
* Copy IAM user sign-in URL from dashboard

* Create account alias: generic_alias (must be globally unique and lowercase)

* Use alias-based URL for easier login:
  
```
https://adguadgu.signin.aws.amazon.com/console
```

# ✅ Final Notes
