# 2.4 Requisites overview 
 
# 📚 Course Prerequisites & Expectations
* **Programming Knowledge:** A general understanding of basic programming concepts like conditionals and loops is helpful, but not mandatory.

* **Languages Used:** The course code is written in Node.js and Python, but deep expertise is not required.

* **Focus:** Emphasis is on learning how to interact with AWS services, rather than mastering the underlying code.

# 💻 Hands-On Lab Setup
* **Device Flexibility:** Any computing device with SSH capability (Windows, Mac, Linux, Chromebook, or even a tablet) will work.

* **Cloud Access:** You can also run labs via a virtual machine or EC2 instance on AWS.

# ☁️ AWS Requirements
* **Free Tier Account:** Needed for most of the course.

* **Exception:** The Kinesis service is not included in the AWS free tier—so usage of that part may require separate billing.
