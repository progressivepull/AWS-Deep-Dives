# 24.2 Outlining AWS developer tools 
 
- **AWS Developer Tools Overview**
  - Part of AWS functional areas focused on **development and CI/CD**
  - Designed to help developers build, test, and deploy applications faster

- **Core Developer Tool Categories**
  - **CI/CD Services**
    - CodePipeline
    - CodeCommit
    - CodeBuild
    - CodeDeploy
  - **Development Tools**
    - CodeStar
    - Cloud9
    - CodeArtifact
  - **Interfaces**
    - AWS CLI
    - AWS CloudShell (browser-based CLI environment)
  - **Other Tools**
    - AWS SDKs
    - AWS CDK
    - AWS X-Ray (covered later)

- **Focus of This Lesson**
  - End-to-end **CI/CD pipeline** using AWS-native tools
  - Emphasis on how tools work together to deploy applications quickly
  - Main services covered:
    - CodeStar
    - CodePipeline
    - CodeCommit
    - CodeBuild
    - CodeDeploy

- **AWS CodeStar**
  - All-in-one **project management and CI/CD solution**
  - Uses templates for web apps and services
  - Automatically provisions:
    - CodeCommit repository
    - CodePipeline pipeline
    - CodeBuild project
    - CodeDeploy application
    - Supporting infrastructure (e.g., EC2 instances)
  - Provides:
    - Single dashboard for commits, builds, and deployments
    - Team member management without complex IAM setup
    - Integration with Jira and built-in wiki
  - Enables automatic deployment on code commit (if approvals are disabled)

- **CodePipeline**
  - Orchestrates **continuous integration and continuous delivery**
  - Pipeline stages typically include:
    - Source
    - Build
    - Test
    - Approval
    - Deploy
  - Common AWS integrations:
    - Source: CodeCommit, S3, GitHub, Bitbucket
    - Build: CodeBuild
    - Deploy: CodeDeploy, Elastic Beanstalk, ECS, CloudFormation
  - Pipelines are triggered automatically on code commits

- **CI/CD Artifact Flow**
  - Source stage outputs an **artifact** to S3
  - Build stage consumes source artifact and produces a new artifact
  - Deploy stage consumes build artifact and deploys it
  - S3 acts as the intermediary artifact store

- **CodeBuild**
  - Managed, scalable build service
  - Pay only for build time used
  - Supports popular languages and environments
  - Uses `buildspec.yaml` to define build steps
  - Build environments:
    - Ubuntu
    - Windows
  - Can pull source from:
    - S3
    - CodeCommit
    - GitHub / GitHub Enterprise
    - Bitbucket

- **CodeDeploy**
  - Automates application deployments
  - Supports:
    - EC2
    - On-premises servers
    - AWS Lambda
  - Key features:
    - Automated deployments
    - Health monitoring with rollback
    - Centralized reporting
    - SNS notifications
  - Requires **CodeDeploy agent** on EC2 or on-prem servers
  - Uses `appspec.yaml` to define deployment steps

- **Deployment Strategies**
  - **In-place deployment**
    - Stops app, updates it, restarts
    - Often combined with load balancers to reduce downtime
  - **Blue/Green deployment**
    - Deploys new version to separate instances
    - Shifts traffic after validation
    - Minimizes risk and downtime

- **Flexibility**
  - AWS Developer Tools are optional but tightly integrated
  - Can use third-party tools:
    - GitHub instead of CodeCommit
    - Jenkins, TeamCity, Solano instead of CodeBuild

- **Key Takeaway**
  - AWS Developer Tools provide a powerful, fully managed CI/CD ecosystem
  - Services can be used individually or together
  - Enable rapid, automated delivery from code commit to production
