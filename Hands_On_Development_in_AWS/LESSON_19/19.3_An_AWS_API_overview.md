# 19.3 An AWS API overview 
 
- **What is the AWS API**
  - The underlying interface used to interact with all AWS services
  - Serves as the foundation for programmatic access to AWS resources

- **How Developers Typically Interact with AWS**
  - Most developers do **not** call the AWS API directly
  - Common access methods:
    - AWS Management Console
    - AWS Command Line Interface (CLI)
    - AWS Software Development Kits (SDKs)
  - All of these tools use the **AWS API** behind the scenes

- **Direct API Access**
  - Every AWS service exposes its API publicly
  - Developers *can* make direct API calls if needed
  - API usage details are found in **service-specific documentation**

- **API Call Structure**
  - Uses standard **HTTP requests**
  - Includes:
    - Action (operation being performed)
    - Query string parameters
    - API version
    - Authentication parameters

- **Authentication and Signing**
  - Requests must be authenticated using **AWS Signature Version 4**
  - Access key and secret key are used to generate:
    - Authorization headers
    - Or signed query string parameters
  - Signing ensures AWS can verify the caller’s identity

- **Authentication Placement**
  - Authorization data can be sent:
    - In HTTP headers
    - Or as query string parameters

- **Service Examples**
  - EC2 and SQS APIs provide documented endpoints and actions
  - Each service has unique API actions and parameters

- **SDK Advantage**
  - AWS SDKs handle:
    - Request signing
    - Authorization header generation
    - API communication
  - Developers do not need to manually calculate signatures when using SDKs

- **Key Takeaway**
  - The AWS API is always in use, even if indirectly
  - Direct API calls are possible but rarely necessary
  - SDKs simplify development by abstracting API complexity
