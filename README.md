# AWS-Deep-Dives
AWS (Amazon Web Services) is Amazonâ€™s cloud computing platform â€” basically, a massive digital toolbox that lets individuals and companies build, run, and scale applications without needing to own physical servers.

# ðŸ§° Popular AWS services include:

* **EC2(Elastic Compute Cloud)** : Virtual servers for running applications.
* **S3(Simple Storage Service)** : Scalable storage for files and data.
* **Lambda** : Run code without managing servers (aka serverless computing).
* **RDS(Relational Database Service)** : Managed relational databases.
* **SageMaker** : Build and train machine learning models.
*  **Cognito** : Amazon Cognito is a powerful identity management service from AWS that helps you add user authentication, authorization, and user management to your web and mobile apps.

## 5. Lesson 4 Identity and Access Management (IAM)

* An **AWS Region** is a **geographically isolated area** where Amazon Web Services (AWS) hosts its infrastructure to provide cloud services. Each Region consists of multiple **Availability Zones (AZs)**, which are distinct data centers engineered to be isolated from failures in other AZs.
  
* An **Access Control List (ACL)** is a set of rules applied to router or switch interfaces that permit or deny traffic based on criteria such as:
  -  Source IP address
  -  Destination IP address
  -  Protocol (TCP, UDP, ICMP)
  -  Port numbers

* **Network Access Control (NAC)** is a security solution that **controls access to a network** by enforcing policies on devices as they attempt to connect. It ensures that only **authorized and compliant devices** (e.g., laptops, smartphones, IoT devices) can access network resources.
